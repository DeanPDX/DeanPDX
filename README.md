## Hello!

I'm a Portland, Oregon-based Software engineer. A [gopher](https://golang.org/) by way of [.NET](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/). My bread and butter is writing [Angular](https://angular.io/) apps for various clients with golang services and MariaDB / Postgres databases. I have two Angular libraries in the npm ([angular-input-focus](https://www.npmjs.com/package/angular-input-focus) and [angular-validation-summary](https://www.npmjs.com/package/angular-validation-summary)). I write infrequent [blog posts about writing software](https://www.deanpdx.com/) (I try to go for quality over quantity). I'm currently working for [Sembit](https://www.sembit.com/).

Need help with something? I enjoy giving back to the software community so drop me a line!
